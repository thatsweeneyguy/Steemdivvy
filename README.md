# SteemDivvy
A Steem tool for divvying out a payment to multiple users.
### Proposed process:
- Input a total amount to be sent (options for STEEM & SBD)
- Add users to receive a portion of the total
- Designate a percentage of the total to be sent to each user
- SteemDivvy connects to the blockchain (likely with SteemConnect), and sends the payments to each user on the list.
